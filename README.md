 # DiabetesLogisticRegression
This model uses Logistic Regression provided in sklearn.linear_model to predict whether a person has diabetes or not based on given features. 
Diabetes Data set consisting of following features :'Pregnancies', 'Glucose', 'BloodPressure', 'SkinThickness', 'Insulin', 'BMI', 'DiabetesPedigreeFunction', 'Age', 'Outcome'.
The data inputs and targets have been provided as csv files.
I first split the dataset into train and test data and then continued with my Logistic Regression.
I have used preprocessed data in this model.
